# Mock S3 storage

The objective is to provide an S3-compatible service for tests, so a Ceph cluster
is not required. This component uses [mock-s3](https://github.com/jserver/mock-s3).

## Usage:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -e HOST=$COREOS_PRIVATE_IPV4 -v <local directory>:/app/storage deis/mock-store
```

*The use of a local directory `(-v <local directory>)` is optional*


`mock-s3` does not requires an `ACCESS_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` (there is no concept of permissions), but this
component will generate both to keep compatibility with `deis-store-gateway`.

## Containers

The mock store component is composed of one container:

* [mock-store](https://index.docker.io/u/deis/mock-store/) - the blob store gateway,
offering a S3-compatible bucket APIs using the local filesystem as storage.

## Usage

Please consult the [Makefile](Makefile) for current instructions on how to build, test, push,
install, and start **deis/mock-store**.

Note that changes to **deis/mock-store** will *not* be built automatically by the test suite.
Run `make mock-store` from the tests/ directory to update the Docker image used by tests.
