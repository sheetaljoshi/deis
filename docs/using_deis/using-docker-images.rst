:description: How to deploy applications on Deis using Docker Images

Using Docker Images
===================
Deis supports deploying applications via an existing `Docker Image`_.
This is useful for integrating Deis into Docker-based CI/CD pipelines.

Prepare an Application
----------------------
Start by cloning an example application:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/deis/example-go.git
    $ cd example-go
    $ git checkout docker

Next use your local ``docker`` client to build the image and push
it to `DockerHub`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker build -t <username>/example-go .
    $ docker push <username>/example-go

Docker Image Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to deploy Docker images, they must conform to the following requirements:

* The Docker image must EXPOSE only one port
* The port must be listening for a HTTP connection
* A default CMD must be specified for running the container
* Bash should be available in the Docker image

.. note::

    Docker images which expose more than one port will hit `issue 1156`_.

Create an Application
---------------------
Use ``deis create`` to create an application on the :ref:`controller`.

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir -p /tmp/example-go && cd /tmp/example-go
    $ deis create
    Creating application... done, created example-go

.. note::

    The ``deis`` client uses the name of the current directory as the
    default app name.

Deploy the Application
----------------------
Use ``deis pull`` to deploy your application from `DockerHub`_ or
a private registry.

.. code-block:: console

    $ deis pull gabrtv/example-go:latest
    Creating build...  done, v2

    $ curl -s http://example-go.local3.deisapp.com

Because you are deploying a Docker image, the ``cmd`` process type is automatically scaled to 1 on first deploy.

Use ``deis scale cmd=3`` to increase ``cmd`` processes to 3, for example. Scaling a
process type directly changes the number of :ref:`Containers <container>`
running that process.


.. attention::

    Support for Docker registry authentication is coming soon
