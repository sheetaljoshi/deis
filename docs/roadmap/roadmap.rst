Deis Roadmap
============
The Deis Roadmap is a community document created as part of the open :ref:`planning`.
Each roadmap item describes a high-level capability or grouping of features that are deemed
important to the future of Deis.

Given the project's rapid :ref:`Release Schedule, <release_schedule>` roadmap items are designed to provide a sense of
direction over many releases.

Deis Workflow
-------------

Much of the Deis team's efforts are focused on Deis Workflow which represents
the next major stable release. For more information about Deis Workflow visit
`https://deis.com, <https://deis.com>`_ or `https://github.com/deis/workflow, <https://github.com/deis/workflow>`_.

Deis Workflow will follow the same open planning and roadmap process as Deis v1
published `here, <https://deis.com/docs/workflow/roadmap/roadmap/>`_.

Deis v1 Maintenance
-------------------

Now that Deis Workflow has seen its first stable release, Deis v1 is officially
under maintenance. We will continue to track upstream CoreOS version bumps,
security patches and patch submissions made by the community.
